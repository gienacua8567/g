            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-8"><p><strong>Herbs generally refer to plants that naturally add flavor or seasoning to food. These are usually the green or leafy parts of some plants that are specifically used for such. They are usually used in place of excessive salt. Aside from flavoring or seasoning, herbs are used for medicinal purposes. A lot of our modern-day medicine coming from our pharmaceuticals were derived from herbs.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Going back to cooking, herbs can be used as a single ingredient or a combination of different herbs. Do you still remember the tag line of a popular fried chicken brand, “made of eleven secret herbs and spices.” Well, it can’t really be that much of a secret I suppose. Although, there are in fact, many kinds of herbs that can be used in cooking. You can even make a whole garden out of it. Hey! That’s not such a bad idea. A lot of people who are already into using and understanding the benefits of herbs in food are actually doing it. Here’s why.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>As mentioned herbs are the leafy parts of the plants that give out the different flavors. For some people, they find it much better to use it as fresh as possible. For some, they use it dried. It doesn’t really matter how you prefer to use it but the really interesting thing about it is that the flavor stays distinct for each kind. Also, by combining or mixing a few of each kind together, you make up your own distinct and original flavor.  
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>If you are new to herbs, using it may take a little getting used to. There are lots of ways you can incorporate it into your food. One way is to rub it into the meat of your main ingredient as in chicken, beef, pork, etc. Rubbing it in is best for recipes for grilling or frying. Another way is to add it to your marinade. This way, the flavor of the herb will sip into the meat together with the other ingredients in your marinade. Others would like to add directly to their cooked meal as in a pesto. If you are still exploring herbs and its flavors, one good way is to add it to your omelet. It will serve as a good base for your herb and will help bring out the distinctness of the flavor.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>In cooking, the benefits of herbs go beyond just for flavoring or seasoning. Some are packed with antioxidants. Antioxidants protect the cells in our body from “free radicals”  that cause heart disease, cancer, and the like. Take note that what it means is that it helps in the prevention of diseases and not to cure them. Other herbs have antiseptic properties which usually help in digestion. Still, others do contain various vitamins that our body needs. Some would even have antimicrobial properties. This goes to say that using herbs in your cooking does offer a lot of benefits. So the next time you prepare your meal, try to start using some herbs in it. Who knows, you might find some of your old boring recipes might just come to life with a fresh new flavor.
